This is a basic project that will help to consolidate the HTML skills I have
learnt up until this point. These skills include:
- Creating headings
- Creating paragraphs with bold and italic text included
- Including images
- Including links to other pages on the website

This will take the form of a recipe website. I hope you enjoy!
